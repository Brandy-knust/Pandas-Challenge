# Pandas-Challenge
For the Pandas Challenge homework, we looked at video game data of in game purchases. We sorted the purchases throughout the challenge by different variables to look at different data.
We looked at the data by gender, and looked at items purchased, total value, average purchase price, etc.
We looked at the data by age, and by all of the previous categories.
We looked at the data by individuals and found the top spenders.
We looked at the top items purchased and their value.

From looking at all of these different analyses, I found that while male by far make up the overwhelming majority of the players, females and non-disclosed/other genders spend more on average per purchase. 
While the largest percentage of players fall in the 15-29 age range, the largest average purchase by player is in the 35-39 and 10 and under range, which could lead one to believe that maybe parents and their children are making purchase on games they play together.
Several of the top players purchase two or three items at a time, but they are not always to top items price wise based on the average purchase price.
